# -Asif556-Smart-Object-Detection-and-Identification-System-

Project Overview
This project is an autonomous car built with Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and Raspberry Pi for object recognition. The goal is to enable the car to navigate its environment autonomously, avoiding obstacles and identifying objects in real-time.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: The car moves and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.
Object Detection: Identifies objects using a camera connected to Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
Real-Time Processing: All processing for obstacle detection and object recognition is done in real-time.
Hardware Components
Arduino UNO (or any compatible microcontroller)
