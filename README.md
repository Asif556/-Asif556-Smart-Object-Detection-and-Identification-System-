<p align="center">An autonomous car project that navigates its environment while detecting and identifying objects in real-time.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    The Smart Object Detection and Identification System is an innovative project that combines robotics with artificial intelligence to create an autonomous car. This car is built using Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, and it is designed to navigate its surroundings safely while detecting obstacles and recognizing objects in real-time.
</p>
<p>
    Leveraging an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, the car can autonomously adjust its path to avoid collisions. The integration of a camera with the Raspberry Pi enables it to identify various objects, making this project a fascinating intersection of hardware and software technologies.
</p>
<p>
    This project serves as an excellent demonstration of how autonomous systems can operate in real-world environments, showcasing the capabilities of modern sensors and machine learning models for object identification.
